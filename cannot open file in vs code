I am using python to write a code that imports a file and extrats the data to create a plot, but unfortunately I am getting a "FileNotFound" 
error even though the csv file exists in the same directory as the code. And not just that, I tried importing a .txt file, and I am receiving
the same error. Is there any solution to this problem or do I have to install an extension?
